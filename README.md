# My Coding Portfolio

Tank Survival - My own original code for a 2D tank shooter survival game I started.

BuildingEscape - Contains code for a puzzle game where you must find and object to place on a pressure plate to open a door in order to escape the room. This game was created in UE4.

Third Person arena - Contains code used in https://play.unity.com/mg/other/third-person-arena which I created with help of a book.
